					Virtual Private Networks 


- A virtual private networks is a network that is secuer and has attributes of a LAN but over a much larger scale.


- VPNS are private data networks over public network - usually the internet.


- VPNS extend corporate networks to remote offices, mobile users, telecommuters and other extranet partners.


- VPNs use advanced encryption and tunneling technology to establish secure, end-to-end private network connections over the internet



Whats the purpose?

 - Extend communications on a global scale

 - Create better communication with business partners 

 - Decrease the cost of having to use traditional methods

 - Faster more effective reliable business 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Site to Site VPNS 


- Connects two entire networks

- Configured on a router or a firewall on both networks

- IPSEC VPN often used for site to site vpns, but can also be used for remote access vpns.

- Good to connect one or more offices together.


Remote Access VPNS 


- Grants access to the corporate network, only for one device. Could be a laptop, desktop or smartphone.

- Allows host computer to safely send encrypted data over the public internet. 

- Requires an application on the host. 

- OpenVPN, SyscoConnect

- TLS is used for remote access vpns, 

- TLS uses port 443. 


Full Tunnels


- Once connected to the vpn all traffic will be forwarded to the corporate network. 


Split Tunnel 

- Only traffic directed to the network is sent to the corporate network 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Device Types: Hardware

- Usually a VPN type of router. 

- Adding encryption support to existing router(s) can keep the upgrade costs of vpns low. 

Pros:
 
- Highest network throughput

- Plug and Play

- Dual Purpose

Cons

- Cost

- Lack of Flexibility

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Device Types: Firewall

Workable solution for small networks with low traffic and volume

Pros:

- Harden OS 

- Tri Purpose

- Cost Effective 

Cons 

- Still Expensive

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Device Types: Software 

- Ideal for 2 end points not in the same organization 

- Great when different firewalls are implemented

- Good solution for better understanding a VPN, software runs on existing servers and share resources with them 


Pros 

- Flexible 

- Relatively low cost

Cons 

- Lack of efficiency

- More labor training required

- Lower productivity; higher labor costs. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Device Types: Internet Security Devices 

- Standalone VPN devices specifically designed for tunneling, encryption and authentication are easier to setup and make attractive choices for businessses looking for 'turnkey' solutions 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VPN Solutions 

- Remote access VPNS establish secure, encrypted connections between mobile or remote users and their corporastre networks via a third--party network such as an ISP. 

- Encrypted dconnections between mobile or remote users and their corporate networks.

- Remote user can make a local call to an ISP, as opposed dto a long-distance call to the corporate remote access server.

- Ideal for a telecommuter or mobile salespeople.

- VPN allows mobile wworkers & telecommuters to take advantage of broadband connectivity. i.e DSL, Cable. 

- VPN Client - Software, hardware as well as router or firewall based solutions available. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


VPN Solutions cntd... 


- Intranet VPNS provide full access to a companys network, a network where all employees can create content, communicate, collaborate and develop. 


 - Site to Site VPNS are an alternative WAN infrastructure that is used to connect branch offices, home offices, or business partners' sites to all or portions of a company's network.

	0 Large-scale encryption between mumltiple fixed sites such as remote offices and central      offices 
	0 Network traffic is sent over the branch office Internet connection.

	0 This saves the company hardware and management expenses




Extranet VPNS provide business partners with limited access to a company's network.

Trusted VPNS 


- Companies lease circuits from communication providers and use them in the same manner they use physical cables in a private LAN. 

- Communication provider is trusted for data integrity and security. 

- Used before internet became universal 

Secure VPNS  use Internet as a corporate communication medium. Data is encrypted before sending, moved over to the internet, and then decrypted at the receiving end. 

	0 Encrytion creates a security 'tunne;' that can't be attacked.

	0 More desireable than trusted VPNs

Hybrid VPNs - A secure VPN is created as part of the trusted VPN thus creating a 'hybrid' VPN. Secure part ot the VPN is usually administered by customers (using VPN equipment) 

	0 Secure VPNs that are administered by ISPs are called provider-provisioned VPNs

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PPTP Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol 

- Its the most widely supported VPN method among Windows users and it was created by Microsoft in association with other technology companies..

- Compared to other methods, PPTP is faster, and it is also available for Linux and Mac users. .

- Voluntary tunneling method 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

L2TP - Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol 

Another tunneling protocol that supports VPNs

- The difference b etween PPTP and L2TP is that the second one provides not only data confidentiality, but also data integrity. 

- L2TP was developed by Miscrosoft and Cisco as a combination between PPTP and L2F (Layer 2 Forwarding)


- PPTP and L2TP operate at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI Model.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IPSec - Internet Protocol Security 


- IPsec is a collection of multiple related protocols 

- It can be used as a complete VPN protocol solution or simply as the encryption scheme within L2TP or PPTP

- IPsec exists at the neetwork layer (layer 3) of the OSI model.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Encryption


- The VPN client at each end of the tunnel encrypts the data entering the tunnel and decrypts sit at the other end. 

- There are two common forms of encryption 

	0 Symmetric-key encryption

	0 Publuc-key encryption. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VPN  Management 

Management of devices - simpler is better. 

	0 Element-based less expensive, adequate for managing and monitoring small setups. 

	0 Policy-based centralized for larger networks, policies established and push them to all applicable devices. - Outsource VPN management to the ISP or ASP 

- VPNs provide reliable access to the network 

- VPN software allows transmitted data packets to transparently switch over to a different path in case of a device failure. 

- Redundancy in hardware components reduces the risk of downtime. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benefits of Using VPNs

- Lower costs

- Connectivity improvemenets, VPN based links are easy and inexpensive ways to meet changing business demands

- Anywhere anytime access, internet access, VPN connectivity. 

- Scalability. 

Disadvantages 

- VPNs require an in-depth understanding of public network security issues and proper deployment of precautions

- Availability ansd performance depends on factors largely outside of their control. 

- Immature standards.

- VPNs need to accomodate protocols other than IP and existing internal network technology.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Industries That May Use a VPN

- Healthcare

- Manufacturing

- Retail

- Banking, Financial

- General Businesses

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where Do We See VPNS Going in the Future?

- VPNs are continually being enhanced 

- More VPNs. 

- Networks are expected to converge to create integrated VPNs

- IMprovides protocols are expected which will improve VPNs.
